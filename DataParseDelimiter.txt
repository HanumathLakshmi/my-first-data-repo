-->What is parse delimited rule?
Parse delimited rule used to parse the data from files and map to the pega properties..
-->Any character can be used as delimiter.
Ex: , or | or "" etc

Suppose if I use "," as delimiter then the raw data (Goutham, A, Cust001) can be mapped to the properties
FirstName ,LastName, CustomerId respectively.

-->Normally an external system provides the data, they always use some delimiter , or | or "" etc.

-->Where can we refer the parse delimited Rule?
1.In Activity using "Apply-Parse-Delimited" method.
2. Mostly with "Service File" rule

Godutham,A,Cust001/,Ind

Configurations...

Record Type:Used to group similar delimited rules used for specific pupose.

Comma Seperated Values:
used when supplied input file is .csv format.
Escape Character:
Escape character always shuld com just before the delimiter which needs to be ignored.
Ex:Goutham, Anumula, Cust001 /,India


Parsing Details:This block is used for only 2 methods 1.Use Parse Details,2.Build Value List:

1.Use Parse Details: 
Propeties should be mapped in "Parsing Details Section"
2.Build Value List:
It should be mapped to clipboard property of type valuelist : Ex; OOTB value list property TelephoneNumber
3.Build Tag List:
Builds a value list same as (Same as build value list),but this uses standard property pyTagList and defined inbuilt and get mapped to a page "Work" in Standard thread.We cannot change these default settings.

Note:Only BuildTagList method creates a new Page Work and save the header in pyTabList, UseTagList method uses the .pyTagList values(Properties Parsed) and updates the values in the Primary page.
Pega internally uses two mapTo functions above two jobs
1.parseCsvHeader:Parse the header line and save it to .pyTagList Property
2.parseCsvDetail:Finds the Work Page and uses the .pyTaglist values to parse the data.

Use of Apply parse delimited method in Activity:
